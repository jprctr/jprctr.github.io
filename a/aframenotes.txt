A-Frame is an open source library for creating VR experiences on the web. It's developed by the Mozilla VR team.

It works on desktop, iOS, Android, and Oculus. Even if you don't have something big and expensive like the Oculus, it will work great on your phone in a simple carboard headset.

Using it looks a lot like writing HTML, with custom elements that make up the elements of your VR scene.

    <a-scene> 

      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -1" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 1" rotation="0 45 0" width="1" height="1" depth="1"  color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 1" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>

      <a-plane rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
